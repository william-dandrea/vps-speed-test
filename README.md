# vps-speed-test

The goal of this project is to create a project that will be deployed on 
a VPS for testing it capabilities (with Gatling for exemple)

It is a very simple project, a NestJS application, connected to a MongoDB
directly connected via a docker-compose.yml

For launching the project, just run `start-all-prod.sh`, and exiting the project with `stop-all-prod.sh`
